[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bradleypallen/anything-but-routine-ld.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bradleypallen/anything-but-routine-ld)

## Overview

This repository contains work towards [a linked data representation of
the bibliographical metadata](http://www.bradleypallen.org/anything-but-routine-ld/) captured in [Anything But Routine (ABR)](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0xj4d6bm),
Brian E.C. Schottlaender's annotated bibliography of works by and about [William S. Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs), the American Beat Generation
author.

## Goals

- Explore the utility of linked data combined with Github-style collaboration platforms in creating. publishing and maintaining bibliographies and catalogs for rare materials
- Explore platforms for data analytics applied to rare book bibliographies and catalogs, in the spirit of the [Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/)
- Investigate the utility of [BIBFRAME 2.0](http://www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/index.html) for bibliographies and catalogs of rare materials typical of those created by and for rare book collectors and sellers
- Gain and share experience in the description of such materials in BIBFRAME 2.0 and other BIBFRAME extension ontologies
- Exploit all of the above in building a linked data resource for [my own Burroughs collection](http://bradleypallen.org/wsb-catalog)

Design decisions and relevant musings are documented on [this project's wiki.](https://github.com/bradleypallen/anything-but-routine-ld/wiki)

## Disclaimer

Still working out the details and best practices to apply. Lots of cleanup to do at this point. I'm not a trained cataloger, though if you hum a few bars I can fake it. Just kidding.
