First, I have preserved a little more of the roughness in Burroughs’ manuscript, not making a number of very small corrections ... And second, as well as reediting and retitling the epilogue (now, ‘Two Years Later: Mexico City Return’), and re-creating the ‘Panama’ chapter (chapter 7), I have made a number of short insertions of material that was either previously unused or unavailable—roughly five hundred words in the notes and just over a thousand in the text.”—Introduction." ] ;
