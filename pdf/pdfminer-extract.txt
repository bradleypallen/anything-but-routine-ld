PREFACE to v. 4.0 

 
 
This fourth edition of Anything but Routine is extensively revised from its predecessor, 2012’s v. 3.0. 
Section B (ART BOOKS, EXHIBITION CATALOGUES, AND RELATED ITEMS) has been 
rearranged by date, to bring it into line with Sections A and C. I am grateful to Rob Melton for the 
suggestion. 
 
Promotional materials (press kits, press releases, promotional postcards,  promotional posters, 
prospectuses) have been brought together with the items they promote, when they do indeed 
promote a single item. Otherwise, they remain in Section G (MISCELLANEOUS).  
 
Section I (BIBLIOGRAPHY AND CRITICISM) has been sub-divided into, well, “Bibliography” 
and “Criticism” due to the proliferation of titles in the latter category. Again, I am grateful to Rob 
Melton for the suggestion. 
 
Quantitatively, v. 4.0 includes 1,271 numbered entries, as compared to the 1,152 numbered entries in 
v 3.0., an increase of more than 10%.

INTRODUCTION 

 
 
The bibliography of William S. Burroughs is as challenging as the man was himself.  He wrote 
voluminously and kaleidoscopically.  He rearranged, recycled, and reiterated obsessively. He 
produced across five decades and four continents. He was a novelist, a poet, an essayist, and a 
correspondent at home in all media.  He never met a “little magazine” or an interviewer he wouldn’t 
share with. 
 
There have been a few attempts at documenting the range of Burroughs’ prodigious output over the 
years—some better than others.  I initially conceived of this bibliography as an update of Joe 
Maynard’s and Barry Miles’ definitive William S. Burroughs: A Bibliography, 195373: Unlocking Inspector 
Lee’s Word Hoard (University of Virginia, 1978).  Readers familiar with Maynard and Miles (referred 
to herein as M&M) will know that this bibliography differs somewhat from that in scope, as it does 
in organization and in the kind and quantity of detail in- or excluded.  These differences 
notwithstanding, my hope is that the two will be found to complement one another, to which end I 
have made a systematic effort to explicitly link the entries in Maynard and Miles to those in my own 
bibliography when such entries appear in both. 
   
For verification purposes, I have personally examined the great majority of items described in the 
bibliography.  In a few instances, I have gotten by with a little help from my friends: booksellers, 
collectors, and librarians.  In fewer instances still, the hunt continues—as I imagine, and hope, it 
will.   
 
The A section of this bibliography details Burroughs’ publications in book, broadside, and pamphlet 
form.  Foreign titles are included only if they have no English-language analogue (e.g., A16) or 
represent the first publication of a particular title (e.g., A34a). Entries are arranged chronologically, 
then alphabetically by title. 
 
The B section details Burroughs’ art books (several of which were co-authored) and catalogs of 
exhibitions of his art.  This section has no analogue in Maynard and Miles, and substitutes for their 
own B section: “Contributions to Books and Anthologies” (which are excluded from the present 
work). Entries are arranged chronologically, then alphabetically by author, then alphabetically by 
title. 
 
The C section details Burroughs’ many hundreds of contributions to periodicals. In this section, I 
have made a particular effort to rationalize some of the most complex elements of Burroughs’ 
bibliography, including the “publications within publications” The Burrough and The Moving Times. 
Entries are arranged chronologically, then alphabetically by periodical title. 
 
Section D details foreign translations of Burroughs’ work.  Entries are arranged alphabetically by 
English-language title, then alphabetically by language of translation. 
 
Section E details Burroughs’ own sound recordings, and his contributions to or appearances on  
those by others. Entries are arranged alphabetically by artist, then alphabetically by title.  
 

iv 

 

Section F details the video formats in which Burroughs’ early film work has been made available, 
along with various of Burroughs’ readings and other Burroughs-related material that have also been 
made available as video recordings. Entries are arranged alphabetically by title. 
 
Section G details various miscellaneous items which, while most are not by Burroughs, are 
nevertheless relevant in and to his bibliography. Entries are arranged alphabetically by author, then 
alphabetically by title. 
 
Section H details biographies of, interviews with, and letters by Burroughs; Section I details 
bibliographies and criticism of him. Bibliographic and critical works are included only if issued as 
stand-alone publications, and only if they deal exclusively with Burroughs or if he is named in the 
title. Entries in both sections are arranged alphabetically by author, then alphabetically by title.

SOURCES CONSULTED 

 
 
In compiling Anything but Routine, I have made extensive use of many, if not most, of the other 
Burroughs bibliographies, in addition to a number of auction and bookseller catalogs.  These have 
proven invaluable, especially insofar as the annotations were concerned.  I have found particularly 
useful the following, to which the reader will find occasional attribution throughout; abbreviations 
used for attribution purposes are noted below.

years in preparation.”—Preface.
