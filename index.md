- Contains the texts of Ah Pook Is Here, The Book of Breeething, and Electronic Revolution, above.
- “Ah Pook Is Here was originally planned as a picture book modelled on the surviving Mayan codices. Malcolm McNeill [sic] was to do the illustrations, and I [Burroughs] was to provide the text ... However, owing partly to the expense of full-color reproduction, and because the book falls into neither the category of the conventional illustrated book nor that of a comix publication, there have been difficulties with the arrangements for the complete work ... Finally Malcolm McNeill [sic] and I have decided to publish the text without the artwork, still in hopes of seeing the eventual publication of this work that has been eight years in preparation.”—Preface.
